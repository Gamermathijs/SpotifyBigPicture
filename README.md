# Spotify Playback Info

A Spring Bootâ€“based bot that automatically checks for your currently played Song on Spotify and displays it in a beautiful fullscreen browser page!

## Some Examples

## Note

This bot is in *very* early development stages and probably not 100% stable yet. The biggest problem is getting a reliable `EventSource` stream, since many servers will eventually kill it after some time, regardless of any potential heartbeats trying to keep it alive.
