# Spotify Playback Info

An interface that regularily checks for your current playback status on Spotify and displays the information in a beautiful little browser page. Best used in full-screen, such as on a TV!

## Some Examples

## Features

### Displayed Information

* **Main info:** Song name, artist name, album name with the release year
* **Time:** Current progress of the song with properly formatted times (works even for 1h+ songs!)
* **States:** Whether something is paused, set to shuffle, or repeat/repeat-one
* **Context:** The playlist/album/artist name and the current device
* **Volume:** Appears on the left when volume is changed (see _Haken - Prothetic_ in the examples)

### Idle Mode

The display will automatically enter an idle mode if no Spotify device has been playing music for a while.

### Smooth Transitions

Smoothly fadeout and in from one song's artwork to the next!

### Background Color

The background is a the album artwork again, but stretched to fit the screen and blurred to not clash with the main image too much.

Furthermore, the most dominant color of the art will be used as additional overlay to better increase the contrast, using [ColorThief.js](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief) and a very rough implementation of the [Colorfulness Index defined by Hasler and SÃ¼sstrunk](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/33994/files/HaslerS03.pdf). This closely emulates what Spotify would attempt on a Chromecast.

### Lite Mode

I originally wanted to use this on my Raspberry Pi 3, but unfortunately that little guy just isn't strong enough to smoothly do the song transitions and the background color overlay. These two features can therefore be disabled by adding `?lite` to the URL.

## Note about stability

This bot is in *very* early development stages and probably not 100% stable yet. The biggest problem is getting a reliable `EventSource` stream, since it just dies after somet time (often hours), despite my best attempts to keep it alive with heartbeats and whatnot.

Therefore, any time the connection is lost, the player will automatically try to reestablish one. This usually happens after a few seconds, so as to not mess with the interface, _the player will keep ticking down seconds on its own, despite having no connection_. Perhaps not the cleanest solution on a technical level, but certainly an unobtrusive one for the viewer.
