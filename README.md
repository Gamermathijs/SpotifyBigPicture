# Spotify Discovery Bot

A Spring Bootâ€“based bot that automatically crawls for new releases by your followed artists and puts them into playlists. Never miss a Spotify release again and uncover hidden gems!

Proudly utilizes the [Spotify Web API Java Wrapper](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java).

## Overview

Most new music gets released every week exactly at midnight between Thursday and Friday, but there are exceptions. It has been a top priority of this bot to fetch those at the exact moment they get released. The bot runs once every half hour to search for any new releases.

### Crawling

(Almost) everything visible in the Spotify client is also visible to the Spotify API. Therefore, this bot is really just a sophisticated and automated "look at every artist I'm following and see if they got anything new on the table." However, there are some subtleties one might not think about first.

For example, albums get re-uploaded _all_ the time, often without any sensible explanation. Sometimes albums get uploaded _multiple_ times at once. And sometimes albums even get released to the _wrong artist_ altogether, usually because a rather common name got used by multiple bands â€“ enjoy your low-quality hip hop on the main page of your favorite rock band.

All these tiny nitpicks quickly add up and would render the approach of simply crawling through all artists and adding anything new as rather useless. This is especially true for Appears-On releases, as labels pump out low-quality samplers daily.

This bot does its best effort to filter out any excessive garbage to only leave you with the music you actually care about!

### Playlists

Results get added into one or multiple playlists, separated by what is called an "Album Group". Playlists with new releases will get also receive a dope ðŸ…½ðŸ…´ðŸ†† notification marker:

![Playlists](https://i.imgur.com/TG7keIF.png)

This marker automatically disappears when you play any of the recently added songs to the playlist.

The playlists themselves are fully customizable, can be merged if you don't care about separation as much (as me), and the Album Groups can be individually turned off altogether â€“ e.g. most people won't care about Appears-On releases as much.

## Usage

The bot is rather simple in terms of production environment... it doesn't have any. You will have to do the configuration manually, for now. It will eventually be made available as a web-based application with a straightforward interface. Until then, the old-school approach of setting things up yourself will have to do.

### Database (SQLite)

This bot requires an SQLite-based database to store both any cached data as well as the configuration for the bot itself. You'll find an almost-ready template in `templates/database.db` where you need to set up the client ID and client secret for your ![Spotify Developer App](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). These must be entered in the `bot_config` table.

### Java

I personally have the bot compiled as a Fat JAR and run it on my Raspberry Pi 24/7, and I recommend you also find some sort of permanent hosting solution. Start the compiled JAR from your console using:

```java -jar SpotifyDiscoveryBot.jar /path/to/database.db```

If the database path is omitted, the working directory will be used. If no database is found or it doesn't have the required tables/configuration, the application will immediately halt. In a future release, there will be an automated setup process.

### First Run

During your first run, you will be asked to log in to Spotify to receive your access and refresh token. This is a one-time process. The tokens will be stored in the database and automatically refreshed with each crawl.

In very rare cases you might still be required to re-login (usually due to an internal server change on Spotify's end).

## Options

There are a couple of customizable features available:

* *EP-Separation*: Unfortunately, Spotify doesn't differentiate between Singles and EPs, despite the two being very different. The bot will try its best to detect those and put them into their own playlist. This is either done by simply looking at the title ("The Cool _EP_") or by looking at the number of songs and combined playtime of the release (for example, song count is at least 5 or the duration exceeds 20 minutes.)
* *Live-Separation*: Some people might want to separate studio releases from live ones. Using [Spotify Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/), the bot will read the _liveness_ value of every song on a release and determines whether the release counts as live or not â€“ at least half of the songs on the release need to be qualified as live. The result will get put into a separate playlist.
* *Remix-Separation*: Same drill as the two options above, this option searches for releases that are either named "Remix" or have a certain number of songs with the word "Remix" in them and puts the result into a separate playlist.
* *Intelligent Appears-On Search*: Basically, Appears-On search but it's actually usable. It throws away anything you probably don't care about â€“ namely samplers and compilations. As a bonus, should an artist you follow be featured on a release by another artist you _don't_ follow, only the featured songs will get added because you probably don't care about the rest.
* *Circular Playlist-Fitting*: Spotify playlists are limited to 10000 songs. While plenty for most people not to care, eventually it may run out of space. You can either set it to stop any further additions after reaching its limit or use this option to rotate the playlist in a circular fashion (e.g. new goes in, old goes out to make room).
* *Cache Followed Artists*: It's highly unlikely to have an artist you've literally just started to follow immediately release new music the next minute. To save on bandwidth and also speed up the crawling process, the list of followed artists is cached and refreshed only once per day.

## Final Notes

This project started as a simple script to replace the â€“ in my opinion â€“ feature-lacking ![Spotishine](https://www.spotishine.com). It has since evolved into a passion project with lots of tiny features to make discovering new music on Spotify more convenient.

Anything is subject to change at this point, as it's difficult to walk the line between hobbyist side project and sorta-kinda-serious project. However, as of writing this (March 2020) I consider it pretty much stable.
